## Introduction

### **Touch and Hands**

Only been studied more recently, less than audition and vision.

Benefits of having touch ( reasons for studying it more )

  - detect harmful stimuli

<!-- end list -->

  - experience social behavior

<!-- end list -->

  - communicate emotions

<!-- end list -->

  - object recognition and manipulation

### Information on hands

  - have highest spatial discrimination

<!-- end list -->

  - ability to manipulate objects in fine detail

<!-- end list -->

  - afferent transmission through ascending somatosensory pathway

<!-- end list -->

  - efferent reception via descending motor pathway

### **Bionic hands**

Bionic hands + artificial skin could

  - perceive different dimensions of external haptic information

<!-- end list -->

  - great potential for communicating with complex environments

<!-- end list -->

  - recognize objects

<!-- end list -->

  - engage in social interaction

### **Human somatosensory system**

Preforms 3 main functions

  - exteroception - external perception

<!-- end list -->

  - interoception - internal perception

<!-- end list -->

  - proprioception - self perception

Exteroceptive system information transmission

1.  Peripheral mechanoreceptors

<!-- end list -->

2.  Through spinal cord

<!-- end list -->

3.  Through dorsal column

<!-- end list -->

4.  Through VP in thalamus

<!-- end list -->

5.  To Primary Somatosensory cortex (SI)

<!-- end list -->

6.  To Higher associative area
      - e.g Prefrontal cortex

### **Differentiation of objects**

Aspect of somatosensory system where we can feel two objects are
different but label them the same

1.  Extracting different features from objects

<!-- end list -->

2.  In higher associative areas combing features

<!-- end list -->

3.  Integrating them with prior knowledge

### **Higher order brain networks related to haptic information**

Researchers recognized 5 of these regions

  - Haptic object recognition and memory

<!-- end list -->

  - Body Perception

<!-- end list -->

  - Body Ownership

<!-- end list -->

  - Affective processing

<!-- end list -->

  - Action

## Physical Quantity Recognition

### **Elements of haptic stimulus**

Combination of basic elements forms further characteristics of objects

  - location

<!-- end list -->

  - frequency

<!-- end list -->

  - pressure

### **Object recognition**

Integration of physical quantities with potentially other factors
(emotion, experience)

### **Mechanoreceptor in Human Skin**

Exteroceptive somatosensory system uses low and high threshold
mechanoreceptors

  - innocuous/mechanical → sensed by LTMR

<!-- end list -->

  - noxious → sensed by HTMR

### **LTMR**

Types of low threshold

  - Merkel cells

<!-- end list -->

  - Ruffini ending / corpuscle

<!-- end list -->

  - Meissner corpuscle

<!-- end list -->

  - Pacinian corpuscle

Function : Transfer complex haptic information → neural codes

Innervated by 4 classes of afferent fibers, according to size and
receptive field

  - Type I→ surface of skin, small defined RF

<!-- end list -->

  - Type II → deeper in skin, larger RF

Respond most strongly to pain and temperature

  - Type A
    \(\delta\)δ﻿

<!-- end list -->

  - Type C

### **Merkels cells**

Innervated by SA Type 1 fiber

Respond to

  - corners

<!-- end list -->

  - edges

<!-- end list -->

  - curvatures

Have high spatial resolution → is able to

  - transmit stim. position

<!-- end list -->

  - reconstruct acute spatial images of haptic stim.

### **Ruffini ending**

Associated with SA Type II fibers

Sustained response to (different inter-spike intervals)

  - skin indentation

2 → 4x more sensitive to (than Merkel)

  - skin stretch

<!-- end list -->

  - changes in hand/finger shape

### **Meissner corpuscle**

Innervated by RA Type I fiber

Detect and determine scale of low freq. vibrations

Play role in

  - movement detection across skin

<!-- end list -->

  - grip control

### **Pacinian corpuscle**

Innervated by RA Type II fiber

Constantly firing to detect high freq. vibration

Convey information about → texture of object in hand

### Haptic sensors on artificial skin

Act as mechanoreceptors

Mimic response of LTMR → transfer information about grasped object

  - pressure

<!-- end list -->

  - frequency

<!-- end list -->

  - hardness

<!-- end list -->

  - shape

<!-- end list -->

  - slip

<!-- end list -->

  - texture

Classifications of haptic sensors

  - Capacitive

<!-- end list -->

  - Piezoresistive

<!-- end list -->

  - Piezoelectric

<!-- end list -->

  - Optical

<!-- end list -->

  - Magnetic sensor

### Types of interaction with sensor

Dynamic touch and haptic touch

Dynamic touch

  - Texture and roughness detected by skin sliding across surface of
    objects
      - Related to high-freq. vibration → response in RAII and RAI

Static touch

  - Different haptic sensors measure pressure based on response
    properties of LTMR

### Learning in object recognition

Haptic information stored in Short and Long term memory (STM, LTM)

Neuromorphic circuits emulate memory of artificial skin

-----

## Somatotopic Organization principle

**Somatototopic organization**

The correspondence of a point on the body to an area in the CNS

e.g. finger contacting object will lead to firing of neurons in specific
region of the brain, aka point → point correspondence

⇒ Via somatototpic map we can know which finger is in contact with which
object

**Division of S1**

4 main divisions

  - Area 1
      - larger than A1
    <!-- end list -->
      - responded to up to five fingers

<!-- end list -->

  - Area 2

<!-- end list -->

  - Area 3a

<!-- end list -->

  - Area 3b

Light touch

  - Area 1, 3b

Touch, Proprioception

  - Area 2

Movements of joints

  - Area 3a

Function : S1 processes simple features and detects direction/velocity
of moving target over surface

**Intracortical microstimulation**

Method which was used to restore touch by delivering trains of
electrical pulses directly to somatosensory areas of brain

Worked in animals

  - lead to object discrimination

ICM in long-term spinal cord injuries

  - interface conveyed information about grasped object → created
    mapping between info and brain activity

⇒ basis for implementation of artificial somatosensory system

**Rapid somatosensory reorganization**

Reorganization of cortex after gluing, only minor change but needs more
investigation

**Self-Organizing featuremap of artifical skin**

Skin has alot of nerve endings and its hard to create a high resolution
artitifcal receptor that can replicate these endings, the densities peak
at around 240 units/cm2

integration of large amount of haptic sensory information is challenge
in artificial skin devices

-----

## Somatosensory Processing for Action

### Areas related to haptic perception in brain

S2 neurons have large RF which spans multiple fingers/hands

Respond various types of stimuli

Processing stream from S1 → S2 → posterior insular , frontal cortex

  - associated with object recognition and memory

Action-related processing also occurs in another stream

### Somatosensory system subsystems

  - What

<!-- end list -->

  - Where

Two streams interact symbiotically

Provides improved inhand manipulation, object charactaristics
extraction, feedback control

### Finger tips and palms

Detect finer detail and palms for larger surface and movement postures
to extract information

### Procedures when preceiveing haptic stimuli

Shape recognition

  - contour following

<!-- end list -->

  - enclosure

Information integrated at receptor level and some projected to limbs and
trunk area through spinal cord

Somatosensory and motion information are closely related
